# BollingerTradingStrategy
A systematic trading strategy using Bollinger Bands to create the buy/sell signals.

After inputting one stock, the algorithm calculates a moving average, the standard deviations and the upper and lower bounds of the Bollinger Bands.

It then producdes buy/sell signals if the stocks close price on a given day is below/above the bands.

The signals are also visualised on plots and returns are calulcated from the inputted time frame of the backtest.
